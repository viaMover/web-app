          'Summary:\n\n' +
          'This post outlines a framework for funding Uniswap ecosystem development ' +
          'with grants from the UNI Community Treasury. The program starts small—sponsoring ' +
          'hackathons, for example—but could grow in significance over time ' +
          '(with renewals approved by governance) to fund core protocol development. ' +
          'Grants administration is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, ' +
          'and thus we propose a nimble committee of 6 members —1 lead and 5 reviewers—to ' +
          'deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants, such that funding can be ' +
          'administered without having to put each application to a vote. We propose the program ' +
          'start with an initial cap of $750K per quarter and a limit of 2 quarters before renewal—a ' +
          'sum that we feel is appropriate for an MVP relative to the size of the treasury that UNI ' +
          'token holders are entrusted with allocating.\n\n' +
          'Purpose:\n\n' +
          'The mission of the UGP is to provide valuable resources to help grow the Uniswap ecosystem. ' +

          'identify and respond to the most pressing needs of the ecosystem, as well as the ability to support ' +
          'innovative projects expanding the capabilities of Uniswap. By rewarding talent early with developer ' +
          'incentives, bounties, and infrastructure support, UGP acts as a catalyst for growth and helps to maintain ' +
          'Uniswap as a nexus for DeFi on Ethereum.',
